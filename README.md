## Propeller on a ring

### Description and Images
In this project we collaborated with a partner to create different parts of a ring and key that can make a propeller fly.

### Reflection
A helpful thing that I learned from this assignment was how to do a section view. A section view is where you pretty much slice your part in half so you can see the insides. You can do it by clicking on the view button on the side and scrolling down to the bottom. Then you select the face of the face you want to section view. Another interesting thing I learned was how to make versions which can make to different types of your document. You can do that by clickinbg the button 3 from the top left. It helps to save your progress in case you mess something up.

## Swing Arm

### Description and Images
In this assignment we practiced for the onshape certification test by creating a part in onshape off of a few measurements from a drawing. Then for the second step we changed 3 dimensions and tried to make it not break the design.

### Reflection
Always make constraints before measurements if possible. Try to make as few measurements as you can in onshape unless it is specificaly stated. TYP means typical and tells you that all other instances that look the same have the same measurement. Variables are a helpful tool when you want to make similar parts that are slightly different because they have a few measurements that are different.

## Multi-Part Studio

### Description and Images
This was another practice for the onshape certification but this time we had to make multiple parts in one studio.

### Reflection
You can create multiple parts in a studion and it makes it much easier, especially if those parts are related. It's best to create measurements off of other parts that they are related to so that if you change one thing, it changes everything. When looking at sketches, make sure to figure out which ones would be best to create first. Think about which ones are the base of the whole design.
